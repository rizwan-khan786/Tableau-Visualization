# Walmart Dashboard
I conducted an analysis of Walmart's sales data using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool. The project involved collecting and cleaning large datasets of Walmart's sales data, creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to explore trends and patterns in the data, and developing insights and recommendations for improving Walmart's sales performance. Through this project, I demonstrated my proficiency in data analysis, data visualization, and business intelligence tools like Tableau, as well as my ability to apply these skills to solve real-world problems related to retail sales and marketing.

# Covid Data Analysis:
I worked on a Covid data analysis project using Tableau, which involved collecting and cleaning large datasets of Covid cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across different regions and countries. I built interactive dashboards and visualizations using Tableau to analyze and visualize the data, identifying trends and patterns related to the spread of Covid and the effectiveness of vaccination programs. Through this project, I demonstrated my proficiency in data analysis and visualization tools such as Tableau, as well as my ability to apply these skills to solve real-world problems related to public health and epidemiology. The project also required strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and the ability to communicate findings and recommendations to stakeholders.
